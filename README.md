# Jarvo
Jarvo is more cringe than Jarvis.

## How to use?
- **Step 1**- Clone this junk.

- **Step 2**- Create a models folder because I don't know how to use Git properly.

- **Step 3**- Place GGUF file in your models folder.

- **Step 4**- Update Line 8 of main.py to your model and inference settings.

- **Step 5**- Update Line 10 of main.py to your personal liking.

- **Step 6**- Try to run main.py until import errors are not there because I don't like to create requirements.txt.

- **Step 7**- Have fun.
