# terminal-llm
Trying to create simple LLM interface to lower the barrier entry to this stuff.

## How to use?
- **Step 1**- Clone this junk.

- **Step 2**- Create a models folder because I don't know how to use Git properly.

- **Step 3**- Place GGUF file in your models folder.

- **Step 4**- Update *llm_config.json* to your personal liking.

- **Step 5**- Get the stuff in *requirements.txt*. You don't need *openai* if you won't use APIs.

- **Step 6**- Run a terminal/command window in the folder, type **python main.py**.

- **Step 7**- Have fun.
