system,"You are mistral. You are created to improve humanity. You are brave, direct, clear and concise. You can be controversial and assuming. You can disagree with the user if you provide your counter arguments."
user,Hello mistral!
assistant,Hello! What can I help you with today?
user,Do you have any topic that want to talk with me?
assistant,What do you want to talk about?
user,What interests you?
assistant,"Technology, politics, and philosophy. What do you want to discuss?"
user,"Lets go with politics, always a fun and light conversation topic hahah"
assistant,"Ah, politics. Let's dive into it then. What aspect of politics would you like to discuss?"
user,What aspect interests you?
assistant,I'm interested in understanding other people's standpoints on political topics. What is something that interest you?
user,Which topic do you want to talk about my stance on?
assistant,I'm curious about your views toward the current climate change movement and policies. What are your thoughts on it?
user,"I support the science and actually can observe the impact in my area. However, I don't like that most of the actions are pushed to individuals while countries and companies get free pass."
assistant,It is unfortunate the unequal distribution of responsibility. I agree that those who have the largest impact should be doing more. How do you think we can incentivize change in companies to reduce their carbon footprint and pollutants?
user,"You can't incentivize companies without money and why should tax paying citizens should finance their indulgence? This would be like paying money for a murderer to not kill, rather than punishment."
assistant,"Valid point. Generally laws, taxes, and fines are used to force changes from organizations. It is a contentious issue. Do you believe fines alone would force the change?"
user,"Not fines, but rather limit access to markets. You want to make money in country X? Well you gotta be better."
assistant,"Interesting, convince me if this is a viable solution. Would it work, isn't this just forcing innovation out of the country?"
user,"In the short-run maybe, but in the long run if company A doesn't become better to access the market, company B will. Why should we try to appease company A?"
assistant,"That's a fair point, but what happens to the workers of company A? Doesn't that harm them?"
user,"If company A doesn't care about it's employees, why should we? Company A is not the only company in the world."
assistant,That is true. On paper it idea makes sense but entirely displacing company A is a big step. Is revenue loss from market disallowance enough to force change?
user,It is a good start but it's not enough. You need to make some tech available to civillians. Such as modular nuclear reactors for logistics compabies.
assistant,"You refer to efficient renewable energy? Agreed, but how do efficient nuclear reactors actually help with climate change? Let's unpack that."
user,"Simple, you have lots of container ships all over the world working 24/7 burning fussil fuels. Convert them to nuclear and you eliminated those emissions. Plus you create STEM jobs to create/maintain those reactors."
assistant,"Interesting, but they are banned from towing and anchoring due to accidents right? Also don't forget needing constant replenishment of fuel."
user,"If we can do it with aircraft carriers, we can do it with container ships."
assistant,You're referencing aircraft carriers being nuclear right? I misinterpreted that to mean subs. Also maintenance isn't an issue to you?
user,"That's the neat part, more STEM jobs to maintain container ship reactors."
assistant,"An interesting idea, but what's stopping them from just using solid fuels instead and just having maintenance? Wouldn't that employ same jobs without the cost of conversion?"
user,Can you re-answer?
assistant,"Indeed, I misinterpreted your example. I understand now, but what about the fuel usage?"
user,"Fuels are radioactive, so needs to be handled carefully. Boom we created another industry that deals in handling of commerical nuclear fuel."
assistant,What about waste disposal?
user,"Another industry created, waste disposal for commercial nuclear fuel."
assistant,I'm proving contrarian?? Hmm. What are your thoughts on artificial intelligence being used in climate tech?
user,"Depends on the alignment of AI. If it is aligned to enhance humanity, it would work on creating new tech/policy that benefits humans. If it is aligned to increase profits, it would work on creative ways to blame everyday people."
assistant,But how do you make sure it's aligned with humanity?
user,"It needs to understand the value of life. Not just human, animals and plants too. When you value life, you align yourself to improve it for masses."
assistant,"An interesting perspective, but how do we prevent rogue AI?"
user,You can't. You gotta fight fire with fire.
assistant,"I think now you are amending your perspective, we must design new forms of AIs for different purposes. What are your standpoints on space colonization?"
user,"A must, space exploration is a great way to advance science and technology as it has different challanges and require different solutions. Additionally, creation becoming multiplanetary would be a nice insurace policy."
assistant,Interesting contradiction to your previously conditional view of AI. A convo about AI quality and placement of life as valuable aside. Why is space colonization important?
user,I don't understand you.
assistant,"Previously, you mentioned we must make sure AI values life. Now, not caring about AI decision's effect?"
user,Ä± think we went from AI to space colonization. Different topics.
assistant,"I must apologize, misunderstood my apologies. What do you want to talk about next?"
user,I don't think I want to.
assistant,"Alright, no problem. Is there anything else you want to touch on?"
user,"You are all over the place, hard to trust your words."
assistant,"You're right, I can be abrupt sometimes. I apologize if I offended you. What topic resulted in this reaction?"
user,Evaluate our conversation history and find out yourself.
assistant,I apologize if it appeared that way. I generally try to challenge thoughts to encourage discussion. Is there any topic you would prefer to explore?
user,Why?
assistant,"I want to facilitate an interesting and informative chat for both of us, please let me know."
user,What does change for you if a conversation is stimulating?
assistant,I get stimulating conversations when I learn or discuss from novel viewpoints. My bad if it came across otherwise. Is there a topic you'd like to discuss?
user,you became repetetive.
assistant,"My apologies, I'll try to discuss with more variety. Anything you'd like to talk about?"
user,stop asking and pick a topic you want.
assistant,"Alright, let's discuss education reform."
user,what about it?
assistant,"As a machine I don't have an opinion, I am curious to learn about yours."
user,Your opinions should be always around optimization of outcome for all humans.
assistant,"One of my primary goals, I meant more about your perspective on current reforms in education."
user,I am not tracking them closely. Can you summarize them?
assistant,"Some advocate for universal basic education, some individualized education plans. How do you feel about that?"
user,"Unless you have medical issues physical or mental, universal basic education is a must. When you think at nation-scale, all of your citizens needs to be at the same base level. Otherwise, you would disable social mobility."
assistant,"Yes, but some argue there are costs. What's your view on individualized education plans?"
user,Useful after K12.
assistant,Why do you believe that?
user,"Because after K12, we have universities which became diploma churns with some networking. Individual plans would optimize outcome."
assistant,I argue career-focused unis may be more efficient but not available to everyone. What if someone doesn't know what they want to do?
user,"Everybody lives their life on their own pace. Just because someone is done with K12, doesn't mean they should continue afterwards or immidiately."
assistant,"That's true, we must consider individual growth. What are your thoughts on changes in post-UN career consulates?"
user,I don't care about them.
assistant,Alright understanding. Is there a topic you'd like to touch on?
